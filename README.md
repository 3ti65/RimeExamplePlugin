#RimeExamplePlugin

This is an example plugin to allow you, the community to write your own plugins and support for various unsupported (any Frostbite engine other than FB2 in Battlefield 3) to use the power and technology that Rime provides. This also means you can write complete replacements of Rime's internal plugins if you are so inclined. The API is current in alpha development and is bound to change at a rapid pace.

#Some of the features that are currently available
  - Creating a user interface to be loaded within Rime's floating docking controls
  - Writing to the log file
  - Subscribing and sending messages to interact with the rest of Rime

Sorry for the *extreme* lack of documentation, it was written to be fairly straight forward, loading UI etc is done within Rime and should not need any code plugin-side.

### Version
1.0.0.0

### Tech
To write plugins, there are a few dependencies that are needed.

* RimeCommon - The common function library for Rime.
* WPF - Windows Presentation Foundation

### Development
Want to contribute? You can either contact me using any of the links below. We are looking for community managers and other modders who are interested in working with the Frostbite engine.
